							<!-- <p>And this is <strong>Miniport</strong>, a free, fully responsive HTML5 site template designed by <a href="http://twitter.com/ajlkn">AJ</a> for <a href="http://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</a> &amp; released under the <a href="http://html5up.net/license">CCA license</a>.</p> -->
							<p>People may no longer watch <i>America's Funniest Home Videos</i> nowadays but people share funny clips to their friends and family more than ever in the digital age. With  social interaction ever so limited during the pandemic, W2G site offers a service of watching video clips in real time. For our project, we examine the current UX of such remote interaction.</p>

						<h2>Contextual Inquiry</h2>
						<p>We performed two instances of contextual inquiry, with a total of 5 people. To probe the remote interaction authentically, we watched the users through shared screens on Zoom. As they carried out a handful of tasks that covers the key features of the site, we observed their site interaction carefully and asked questions.</p>

								<h3>Create Room & Share Invite Link</h3>
								<p>The first step to the remote interaction is the initiative of creating a room and sharing an invite link to people. While the users did not have any trouble making a new room, they had some trouble with sharing the invite link. Locating and copying the invite link was not difficult as the users were able to find the yellow '+ Invite friends' button on the top right. However, it was sending out the link itself that gave them a trouble. The users were on their work computer, thus they did not have a messaging app available right away to share the link. One user immediately turned to Gmail to share the link while the other manually typed the link on their phone in a messaging app.</p>

								<h3>Adding Videos to Playlist</h3>
								<p>Submitting a video to the playlist is a crucial interaction to the process. However, to the first time users, the task was not as obvious as it should be. On the very top screen, there is the search bar where a user can enter keywords to search youtube videos and add videos to the playlist. Two of our users did not use the search bar immediately and instead searched the videos on Youtube site itself and copied the video links. After acquiring the links to their desired video, they did not recognize that the top search bar was the place to add videos. After minutes of struggle, they finally inserted the links to the search bar, which returned the video as a search result at the bottom of the screen below the video screen. Only then, they were able to add their clips to the list by clicking the '+' button.</p>

							<div class="col-8 col-7-large col-12-medium">
								<h3>Playlist & Changing Videos</h3>
								<p>On the left of the video is the playlist and history. As the users added their videos, they were able to confirm right away that a new video was added to the queue. Most notably, when the users were searching for a place to add a video, the users looked into the playlist immediately. It is possible that the users not only expected the video adding feature to be within the playlist section but also some of the interface on the playlist is misleading. When prompted to skipping or replaying videos, the users were able to easily click on the desired video.</p>

								<h3>Watching Together</h3>
								<p>While the users were able to add and switch videos, they seemed to have a small impression on the experience of watching together. One user clicked on a video in the playlist without realizing that the video has changed for all the other users. The other user was in a wrong room, yet did not realize it even when other users were adding videos. The entire experience was barely different from watching on youtube itself, as one user would say.</p>

							<h3>Brainstorming</h3>
							<p>Looking at the key issues in our model, we brainstormed how to find solutions for them.</p>
							<li>In the case where direct links is inaccessible, make a room code that's short enough to manually type in.</li>
							<li>Place the video search/add functionality closer to the playlist since it seems to be the spot where most users look to.</li>
							<li>Separate the seach feature and add feature separately so users can efficiently do either of them.</li>
							<li>Place the search/add GUI away from the screen so the video is still visible on screen.</li>
							<li>Make fullscreen mode available on the video control bar.</li>
							<li>In the fullscreen mode, allow access to key features such as chat and add/search.</li>
							<li>Add the react emoji option for interaction.</li>
							<li>Make the anonymous usernames more readable and make the userlist bigger.</li>
